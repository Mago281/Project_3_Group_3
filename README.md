# Project_3_Group_3

 *Telling a story using data visualizations*

1. Our visualisation includes a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one
database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.) and falls into the following three tracks:

    - A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
   
    - A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
   
    - A server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualisation (must be approved)

   
2. Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.
  
3. Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.
  
4. Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes).

5. Your final visualisation should ideally include at least three views.


For this project, you can focus your efforts within a specific industry, as detailed in the following examples.
